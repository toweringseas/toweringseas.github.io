            <h2>Climate Control</h2>
            <p>Climate control at the beach is its own little science! Our proximity to the water and the prevailing winds mean that our bungalow can get humid from time to time. So we have a mix of air conditioners and dehumidifiers across the property.</p>
            <p>Each of the living spaces has an air conditioning unit with a remote control. In the primary bedroom, the remote control is on the bedside table. In the living room, the remote control is attached by magnet to the refrigerator. In the game room, the remote control is on the table by the air conditioning unit.</p>
            <p>We suggest keeping the temperature at 70° in each of those living spaces. Please keep the mode set to auto. Setting the temperature lower than 68° will result in condensation on the floorboards. We usually shut down the air conditioner in the primary bedroom overnight if it’s too noisy.</p>
            <p>If you need additional humidity control, you can turn on the dehumidifier located in the primary bedroom. Simply press the on/off button as the other settings are set optimally. Water will be pumped out of the house so there’s no need to dump the water canister. Before turning the unit on, please make sure the gray tube is securely attached to the back of the dehumidifier.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>TVs</h2>
            <p>Each of the televisions has a Roku device and is powered by a Roku remote control. You should not need any other remote control to operate the televisions. Feel free to use your own credentials to watch Netflix, Hulu, or other streaming channels.</p>
